Omar's Guessing Game
Hey there! Welcome to Omar's Guessing Game, a fun Python distraction I crafted while waiting at an airport. Inspired by the crafty Omar Sulaman, this game is all about unpredictability and sharp focus.

Why This Game?
Stuck at an airport, I needed something to keep my mind sharpâ€”because whether I'm slaying in Dead Cells on the train or coding in a waiting area, staying engaged is key. This game fits right into those little slices of downtime.
